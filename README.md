## Output Structure
1. [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor) - Python library that makes it a breeze to work with structured outputs from large language models. (If you’re importing an LLM API SDK, use Instructor.)
2. [Outlines](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines) - provides ways to control the generation of language models to make their output more predictable. (If you’re importing Huggingface for a self-hosted model, use Outlines.)
